# **World Weather Analysis**

## Overview of Project

The main idea of this project was to use APIs to pull real time weather data and then create a vacation based on some of the data provided. I used JSON traversing, data frame creation, and CSV creation and export in order to complete this project. I also used what we learned in the last lesson in order to visualize the data.

## Results 

### Retrieve Weather Data 

I randomly selected 2,000 latitude and longitudes and gathered weather information about these locations.

### Customer Travel Destination Map 

Vacation destinations were identified as well as hotels that were nearby and these locations were identified by pop up markers.

I created a travel routed to bike around California!
